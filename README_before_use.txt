   IMPORTANT – READ ME **BEFORE** RUNNING ANY PART OF THIS TOOL
=================================================================

The script relies on *relative paths*.  
Please keep the following folders exactly where they are,
next to this script:

  • Relate/          (binary + helper scripts)
  • CLUES2/          (inference.py, RelateToCLUES.py, …)
  • required_files/  (mutation rate tables, recomb map, etc.)
  • phase1/, phase2/ (produced by the previous pipeline steps)

Moving or renaming **any** of these directories – or this script itself –
will break Phase1, Phase2 and Phase-3.

If you really need to reorganise your workspace, update every path inside
the script accordingly *before* launching it.

Happy dating!
