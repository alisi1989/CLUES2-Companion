# Important: Relate and Singer executables are not Conda packages.
# You can either:
#   (i) use the precompiled binaries provided in our GitHub release
#       (Relate-Linux/ and Singer-Linux/ folders), or
#   (ii) download them from the official Relate and Singer repositories.

# After downloading, rename the folders to:
#     Relate/   or Relate-Linux/
#     Singer/   or Singer-Linux/
# and place them in the same directory as CLUES2Companion.

# Required reference data (ancestral FASTA, mask files, recombination maps)
# can be obtained from the official Relate Dropbox or from our release.
# Place these in the "required_files/" folder.

# To set up the environment (Python dependencies):

#conda env create -f Clues2Companion.yml
#conda activate Clues2Companion

# Once activated, you can immediately run Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3
# using either the Relate or Singer pathways.
